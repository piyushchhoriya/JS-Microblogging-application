# JS-Microblogging-application

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a JavaScript Microblogging application focusing on fetching, creating, and updating blog entries. The application fetches existing blogs from a JSON file, allows users to expand blog content, create new blogs, and mark existing blogs as complete.

## User Requirements:
View all existing blogs fetched from the JSON file using XMLHttpRequest.
Click on a blog to expand its content (utilizing CSS transitions).
Add a new blog by clicking the create button, opening an editable card with blog details.
Add a blog by entering title, content, and author, with a created field auto-filled with date and time.
Update a blog as complete by clicking an update icon, with only content and author fields editable.

## Technical Requirements:
Utilize SCSS for styles.
Document code extensively.
Include .gitignore and ReadMe.md files.
Build your own UI design, without using JavaScript & CSS libraries.
Do not save UI changes to a JSON file.

## Steps to Run:
Clone the repository.
Run npm install.
Open the project directory with live server to view the application.
This project is an implementation of a JavaScript Microblogging application, focusing on user interaction and functionality without the use of external libraries.
